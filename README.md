    * The system loads product and user data from text files ("products.txt" and "users.txt") following specific formats.
    * Invalid inputs are validated, and clear error messages are displayed for any invalid data.


  ## Project Scope:
  
    This project involves the development of an interactive online shopping system that provides role-based access, efficient product management,
    and a seamless shopping  experience. It ensures data integrity, user authentication, and comprehensive input validation for a reliable e-commerce platform.
